#### As Product Owner, I want the project to have a REST API (HTTP REST controllers, implemented using Spring Boot, including HATEOAS).

### Description
To create a REST API, WebControllers must be created so that other systems can communicate with the SmartHome system.  
The Spring Framework should be integrated into the project to support the REST API.

### Steps to support REST
1. Add new dependencies required by Spring to the pom.xml project file;
2. Add annotations to the required classes and alter possible affected classes;
3. Create WebDTOs and WebMapperDTos to be used by the WebControllers;
4. Create WebControllers for each domain aggregate that needs to be exposed.

### Refactor tests
- For all tests: Due to refactoring caused by dependency injection and addition on annotations, affected classes such as: ImpFactory, Repository SpringData, Services; current tests should be adapted to follow these changes.
### New WebController Tests
- For all tests: For all WebControllers, integration tests should be used and should use the different available repository types.  
- Success/Fail tests: Success/Fail tests for each controller depend on the method being tested and their necessities.

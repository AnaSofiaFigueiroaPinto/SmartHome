### Description
This user story requires the access all the sensor and actuator functionalities, their respective sensors and actuators, as well as the devices to which they belong to and the room of the said devices.

### Use cases
- List of all devices in house, grouped by functionality


### Acceptance tests
- For all tests: The required repositories should be created, as well as the mappers involved in transforming the Functionality, Device and Room objects to DTOs.


- Success test: Test if a Map of deviceDTO, with their location (roomDTO) represented, are grouped by the functionalityDTO equivalent of the existing functionalities in a successful manner. The method should return a map of devicesDTO with the same size has the amount of devices created with the existing functionalities. If rooms and devices with no functionalities are present, the Map should return empty, but valid.
- Fail test: Test if the result is null if there are no rooms in the repository.
- Fail test: Test if the result is null if there are no devices in the repository.

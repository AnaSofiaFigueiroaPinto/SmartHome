#### As Product Owner, I want the system to support data persistence using JPA.

### Description
Several implementations and updates will be needed to allow the system to support data persistence using JPA.

### Steps to support data persistence
1. Create Data Models for each domain aggregate that needs to be persisted;
2. Create Mappers for Data Model classes that needs to be persisted;
3. Implement repositories for each aggregate that needs to be persisted.

### Acceptance tests
- Success test: Test if the object is successfully obtained from persistence. Check if the object is successfully converted from data model to domain object;
- Success test: Test if the list of objects is successfully obtained from persistence. Check if the object is successfully converted from data model to domain object;
- Success test: Test if the object exists in persistence;
- Success test: Test if the object is successfully saved in persistence;
- Fail tests: Test fails if the parameters are invalid or the conversion from data model to domain it is not successfully made.

#### As a Room Owner [or Power User, or Administrator], I want to get a list of all measurement of a device in a room, in a given period.

### Description
In order to achieve this, the Room Owner [or Power User, or Administrator] should have access to a list of all rooms, list of all devices for a chosen room. Then for a chosen device, the system should retrieve all measurements of all sensors that belong to the chosen device, for a given period.

### Use cases
- List rooms of house
- List devices in room
- List measurements in a given period for all sensors belonging to a device

### Acceptance tests
- For all tests: A valid house should be created, rooms should be created for the house and devices should be created for the rooms. For each device, sensors should be created and added, and some measurements should be created for each sensor.  
  
  

- Success test: Test if all values created for a specific sensor are returned to the user. Method should return a map of SensorFunctionalityDTO as a key and a list of ValueDTO as a value.
- Fail test: Fail to return values for a device that does not exist. Method should return an empty map.
- Fail test: Fail to return values for a device with no sensors. Method should return an empty map.
- Fail test: Fail to return values for a device that has no readings in the given period. Method should return an empty map.

#### _As a Power User , I want to configure a device in a room using the Web App._

### Description
This functional requirement includes the following features:
- deactivate a device
- add a new sensor to a device
- add a new actuator to a device

### Planning
In order to accomplish all requirements, 3 endpoints that already exist in our REST API will be used:
- Deactivate a device: PATCH {API_URL}/devices/{deviceId}
- Add a new sensor to a device: POST {API_URL}/sensors
- Add a new actuator to a device: POST {API_URL}/actuators

These features will be available in the device details (when accessing the device list page), where the user can see all the information about the device and interact with it.

### Implementation
#### Step 1
In `frontend/src/services/devices.service.js`:
- Add a new function to handle the deactivation of a device using the PATCH endpoint.
- Add a new function to handle adding a sensor to a device using the POST endpoint for sensors.
- Add a new function to handle adding an actuator to a device using the POST endpoint for actuators.

#### Step 2
The component `frontend/src/components/RoomDevices.js` will be updated to:
- Import the new service functions.
- Update the UI to include a switch for deactivating a device:
    - Ensure the switch is initialized with the device's current status and can call the deactivation function on change.
- Add buttons or forms to the UI for adding sensors and actuators to the device:
    - Ensure these buttons/forms call the respective functions to add a sensor or actuator when triggered.

#### Step 3
Finally, the CSS will be updated to style the new elements added to `RoomDevices.js`.
This will ensure that the switch, buttons, or forms are properly styled and fit within the existing design of the page.
